# MLAssignments

This repository contains all my implementations of machine learning algorithms from my specialization. Implementations of algorithms are done using the Turi Create library in the first course [ML Using Turi Create](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/ML%20Using%20TuriCreate%20Library). For the remaining 3 courses ([Regression From Scratch](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/Regression%20from%20Scratch), [Classification From Scratch](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/Classification%20from%20Scratch), [Clustering & Retrieval From Scratch](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/Clustering%20%26%20Retrieval%20from%20Scratch)), implementations are done from scratch.
Topics covered in Regression - simple regression, polynomial regression, overfitting, gradient descent, ridge regression, lasso regression, coordinate descent and K-nearest neighbor regression
