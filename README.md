# MLAssignments

This repository contains all my implementations of machine learning algorithms from my specialization. 
Implementations of algorithms are done using the Turi Create library in the first course [ML Using Turi Create](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/ML%20Using%20TuriCreate%20Library). 

Topics covered here are the TuriCreate library and brief introduction to all types of machine learning algorithms implemented using TuriCreate. Algorithms implemented involve regression, classification, clustering and retrieval, recommender systems and deep learning  


For the remaining 3 courses ([Regression From Scratch](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/Regression%20from%20Scratch), [Classification From Scratch](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/Classification%20from%20Scratch), [Clustering & Retrieval From Scratch](https://github.com/osherboudara99/MLAssignments/tree/main/Clustering%20%26%20Retrieval%20from%20Scratch)), assignments delve into the algorithms that accompany the these general machine learning topics and implementations are done from scratch.

Topics covered in Regression implementations - simple regression, polynomial regression, overfitting, gradient descent, ridge regression, lasso regression, coordinate descent and K-nearest neighbor regression

Topics covered in Classification implementations - linear classifiers, logisitic regression, L1 and L2 regularization, decision trees and overfitting, boosting, precision and recall, stochastic gradient descent for huge datasets

Topics covered in Clustering and Retrieval implementations - nearest neighbor search, locality sensitive hashing, k-means, mixture models, expectation maximization, latent dirichlet allocation, hierarchical clustering
